Revision history for Perl extension Exception::Class::DBI.

0.91  Tue Aug 26 02:25:56 2003
        - Switched to Module::Build.
        - Throwing exceptions with the "throw()" method, rather than
          die'ing with the construction of exceptions with the "net()"
          constructor.
        - Added POD tests.

0.90  Thu Dec 12 20:16:14 2002
        - Updated tests for Changes in DBI 1.30. Connection failures
          can now throw exceptions!
        - Removed TODO tests in sth.t. Tim has said that DBI attributes
          that return ARRAYs or HASHes will return undef when they're
          empty, rather than return emtpy ARRAYs or HASHes.
        - Incremented version to 0.90 to indicate high level of stability.

0.02  Tue Sep 17 03:33:56 2002

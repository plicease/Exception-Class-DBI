Exception/Class/DBI version 0.97
================================

This module offers a set of DBI-specific exception classes. They inherit from
Exception::Class::Base, the base class for all exception objects created by
the Exception::Class module from the CPAN. Exception::Class::DBI itself offers
a single class method, C<handler()>, that returns a code reference appropriate
for passing the DBI C<HandleError> attribute.

The exception classes created by Exception::Class::DBI are designed to be
thrown in certain DBI contexts; the code reference returned by handler() and
passed to the DBI C<HandleError> attribute determines the context, assembles
the necessary metadata, and throws the apopropriate exception.

Each of the Exception::Class::DBI classes offers a set of object accessor
methods in addition to those provided by Exception::Class::Base. These can be
used to output detailed output in the event of an exception.
